What does SSH stand for, and what is its purpose?	SSH stands for Secure Shell, and it is used to securely connect to a remote computer.
How do you connect to Cornell's resources from off-campus?	Use Cornell's VPN to simulate being on campus, then use SSH.
What command copies a file from a remote machine to your local machine using SSH?	`scp <user>@<host>:<source> <dest>`
What are the key elements of a variable declaration in C?	A variable declaration includes the type and variable name, ending with a semicolon.
How do you initialize an integer variable in C?	`int x = 10;` initializes an integer with a value of 10.
What is an expression in C, and where can it appear?	An expression evaluates to a value and can appear in assignments, loops, or function calls.
What are the four parts of a C function definition?	Return type, function name, parameter list, and function body.
Why does the `main` function always return `int`?	It indicates the program's exit status: 0 for success, non-zero for failure.
How do you pass arguments to a C function?	Arguments are passed inside parentheses, matching the function's parameter types.
What is the purpose of header files in C?	Header files declare functions and variables to be used across multiple files.
How do you include standard library headers vs custom headers?	"Use angle brackets `<stdio.h>` for standard headers and quotes `""file.h""` for custom headers."
What happens if you try to use a function before declaring it in C?	The compiler will throw an error for implicit declarations.
What is the syntax of an `if-else` condition in C?	`if (condition) { ... } else { ... }`
How does a `for` loop differ from a `while` loop in C?	`for` loops include initialization, condition, and increment; `while` loops only have a condition.
What is the purpose of `break` and `continue` in loops?	`break` exits the loop; `continue` skips to the next iteration.
How do you declare an array of integers with 5 elements?	`int arr[5];`
What happens if you access an index outside an array's bounds in C?	Accessing out-of-bounds elements leads to undefined behavior.
How do you pass an array as a parameter to a function?	Pass the array name (pointer) and its size as separate arguments.
What is a pointer, and how do you declare one in C?	A pointer stores the address of a variable; declare it with `int *ptr;`.
What is the difference between `*` and `&` in C?	`*` dereferences a pointer; `&` gets the address of a variable.
How do you dynamically allocate memory for an integer in C?	`int *ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));`
What is the difference between mutable and immutable strings in C?	Mutable strings can be modified; immutable strings cannot.
Why can’t you use `==` to compare strings in C?	`strcmp` should be used to compare strings.
What is the purpose of the null terminator `\0` in strings?	It marks the end of the string in memory.
How do you declare a struct in C?	`struct Point { int x; int y; };`
What is an enum, and how do you use it in C?	An enum is a user-defined type with named integer constants.
What is the arrow operator (`->`) used for in structs?	It dereferences a pointer to a struct and accesses its fields.
What is the purpose of the `malloc` function in C?	Allocates memory on the heap.
How does `calloc` differ from `malloc`?	`calloc` initializes memory to zero; `malloc` does not.
What does the `free` function do, and why is it important?	Releases allocated memory back to the system.
What is the purpose of a macro in C?	Defines constants and reusable code snippets.
Why should magic numbers be replaced with macros?	Magic numbers make code harder to maintain and understand.
What does `#define SIZE 100` do in C?	Replaces `SIZE` with 100 wherever it appears in the code.
What is RISC-V, and why is it significant?	RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture.
What is the difference between `lw` and `sw` in RISC-V?	`lw` loads a word from memory; `sw` stores a word to memory.
What is the purpose of the `addi` instruction in RISC-V?	Adds an immediate value to a register.
How do you convert the decimal number 37 into binary?	`37` in binary is `100101`.
What is the result of adding binary numbers `1101` and `101`?	`11010`
What is two’s complement representation, and why is it used?	It represents signed numbers by flipping bits and adding one.
What is the purpose of a Makefile?	Automates compilation and linking processes.
What does the `.PHONY` target mean in a Makefile?	Marks targets that do not correspond to files.
How do you define a clean target in a Makefile?	`rm -f *.o *.out`
What is instruction pipelining, and why is it useful?	Overlaps instruction stages to increase throughput.
What are the roles of the ALU and control unit in a CPU?	The ALU performs arithmetic; the control unit orchestrates instructions.
What are the benefits of cache memory in computer systems?	Cache reduces memory access latency.
What does `realloc` do in memory management?	Changes the size of a previously allocated memory block.
What is the result of passing a NULL pointer to `free`?	No operation; `free` ignores NULL pointers.
How do you check for memory leaks in a C program?	Use tools like Valgrind to detect memory leaks.
What is short-circuit evaluation in C?	Short-circuit evaluation skips the second operand if the first determines the result.
What is the difference between `&&` and `||` in logical operations?	`&&` is logical AND; `||` is logical OR.
What does `!` do in a logical expression?	`!` negates the expression.
What are the steps for converting a decimal number to hexadecimal?	Divide the number by 16 repeatedly, recording remainders.
What is the difference between static and dynamic variables in C?	Static variables retain their value across function calls.
What is the significance of the stack and heap in memory management?	The stack handles local variables; the heap handles dynamic memory.
