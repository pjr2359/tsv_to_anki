What is the primary goal of NS3150?	To discuss obesity, its co-morbidities, and understand best practices for weight management to sustain metabolic fitness.
Why is obesity considered an emotionally charged topic?	It involves personal health, societal stigma, and requires sensitivity to avoid judgment of others’ lifestyles or choices.
What is the main weakness of using BMI to define obesity?	BMI does not account for fat mass, bone mass, lean muscle, or genetics.
What is the proximate cause of obesity?	Consuming more calories than expended (energy imbalance).
What is the ultimate cause of obesity?	Underlying factors like genetics, environmental changes (e.g., food availability), and evolutionary adaptations (e.g., thrifty genes).
Why is the proximate cause of obesity not sufficient to explain the obesity epidemic?	It doesn’t address why people overeat or why some individuals gain more weight than others despite similar caloric intake.
Why was obesity rare in hunter-gatherer populations?	High physical activity, unprocessed diets (rich in plants/fiber), and limited access to energy-dense foods.
What dietary change did William Banting advocate in the 1800s?	Avoiding bread, potatoes, and beer to reduce weight (an early low-carb approach).
How did the rise of low-fat diets in the 1900s contribute to obesity?	Low-fat diets led to increased consumption of refined carbohydrates and sugars.
What role did refined carbs play in the 1800s obesity discussion?	They were identified as a primary cause of obesity due to their high caloric density and low satiety.
How is BMR calculated using the Mifflin St. Jeor equation for men?	BMR = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) − (5 × age) + 5.
Why do individuals with obesity have a higher BMR?	More cells and larger organs require more energy, but when adjusted for fat-free mass, TEE remains similar to lean individuals.
What is the thermic effect of food (TEF)?	Energy expended to digest, absorb, and metabolize nutrients (accounts for ~10% of total energy expenditure).
What is the respiratory exchange ratio (RER)?	The ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed, used to determine which macronutrient (carbs, fats, proteins) is being metabolized.
What did the Ethan Sims overfeeding study reveal?	Participants regained their original weight post-study, suggesting a biological 'set point' for weight regulation.
What was a key finding of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment?	Severe calorie restriction reduced organ mass and increased fluid retention, with participants regaining weight post-study.
What is the energy expenditure cap?	The body adapts to increased physical activity by becoming metabolically efficient, limiting total daily energy expenditure.
How does the body compensate for increased exercise?	By reducing non-essential energy use (e.g., immune function, reproductive processes) to maintain energy balance.
Why do Arizona Pima Native Americans have higher obesity rates than their Mexican counterparts?	Adoption of a Western diet (high in processed foods) vs. traditional diets (low-fat, high-fiber).
How do adoption studies support genetic influences on obesity?	Adoptees’ BMIs correlate with biological parents, not adoptive parents, indicating genetic predisposition.
What environmental factors contribute to obesity?	Food availability, sedentary lifestyles, urbanization, and access to energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods.
What is the thrifty gene hypothesis?	Genes favoring fat storage evolved to survive famines, but in modern food-rich environments, these genes promote obesity.
How did the Dutch Hunger Winter study support epigenetic regulation of obesity?	Offspring exposed to famine in utero had higher obesity and diabetes rates, linked to DNA methylation changes in metabolic genes.
What role does the FTO gene play in obesity?	FTO SNPs increase appetite and fat mass without affecting energy expenditure.
What is a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)?	A genetic variation where a single nucleotide is altered, potentially affecting gene expression or protein function.
How do artificial sweeteners affect insulin and glucose levels?	They activate sweet receptors in the gut, priming insulin release but causing delayed glucose spikes due to lack of actual sugar.
What is the Mayer glucostatic theory?	Declines in blood glucose levels trigger hunger, but modern research shows postprandial glucose dips better predict appetite.
How does dopamine influence eating behavior?	Dopamine drives reward-seeking behavior; chronic high-fat diets reduce dopamine sensitivity, leading to overeating.
What are the five basic tastes?	Sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami.
How does a high-fat diet alter taste perception?	Reduces taste bud regeneration and increases inflammation, blunting sweet/salty sensitivity.
What is ghrelin’s role in appetite regulation?	Ghrelin, produced in the stomach, stimulates hunger by activating NPY/AgRP neurons in the hypothalamus and suppressing vagal nerve signals.
Why are ghrelin levels lower in obesity?	Chronic overeating may downregulate ghrelin production, though sensitivity to its effects may also decrease.
What is the role of sweet taste receptors in the gut?	They regulate glucose uptake and insulin release by sensing carbohydrates and triggering GLP-1 secretion.
Why do the Hadza hunter-gatherers have similar total energy expenditure (TEE) to sedentary Westerners?	The body adapts to activity levels by reducing non-essential energy use (e.g., immune function), maintaining TEE stability.
How does the Hadza lifestyle differ from modern humans?	They are more physically active but consume fewer calories, yet their TEE is similar due to metabolic adaptation.
What did the Ukraine Famine study reveal about metabolic disease?	Early gestational famine exposure increased type 2 diabetes risk in offspring, supporting transgenerational epigenetic effects.
How does the CDC explain the obesity epidemic’s rapid rise?	Environmental factors (e.g., processed foods, sedentary lifestyles) dominate, as genetic changes occur too slowly.
What did the Vermont Prison Overfeeding Study show?	Overfeeding led to only a 20-25% weight gain, and participants returned to their original weight post-study.
What was the main finding of the Minnesota Starvation Experiment?	Severe calorie restriction reduced organ mass and increased fluid retention, with participants regaining weight post-study.
What is the evolutionary advantage of the thrifty gene hypothesis?	Genes favoring fat storage provided a survival advantage during famines, allowing individuals to endure food shortages and reproduce.
How does the Dutch Hunger Winter study support the thrifty gene hypothesis?	Offspring exposed to famine in utero had higher obesity and diabetes rates, suggesting epigenetic changes favoring fat storage.
Why is the thrifty gene hypothesis criticized for lack of evolutionary time?	The obesity epidemic emerged rapidly (last 40-50 years), while famines occurred over millennia, making it unlikely for genes to adapt so quickly.
How does the Ukraine Famine study challenge the thrifty gene hypothesis?	The severe famine region showed no phenotypes associated with increased diabetes risk, contradicting the hypothesis.
What is the set-point theory of weight regulation?	The body has a predetermined weight range, and deviations trigger metabolic and behavioral changes to return to this set point.
How does exercise impact total energy expenditure (TEE)?	Exercise increases TEE, but the body compensates by reducing non-essential energy use, creating an energy expenditure cap.
What is the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in appetite regulation?	CCK, released by bitter taste receptors in the gut, signals satiety and reduces food intake.
How do artificial sweeteners prime the body for sugar?	They activate sweet taste receptors, preparing the body for glucose, but no sugar arrives, potentially disrupting metabolic responses.
