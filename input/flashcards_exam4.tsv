Define group privilege.	Group privilege refers to unearned benefits given to dominant societal groups based on group membership. It’s often invisible to those who have it and varies by status dimension.
What is the 'invisible knapsack'?	A metaphor for the unacknowledged privileges associated with being in a dominant group, making those privileges seem invisible to those who benefit from them.
What are meritocratic threats?	Acknowledging privilege can challenge the belief that one’s accomplishments are solely based on hard work and merit, posing a psychological threat.
What are group-image threats?	These threats occur when awareness of group privilege or wrongdoings undermines the self-esteem derived from group membership.
Strategies for managing privileged identities:	Deny: Refusing to acknowledge privilege. Distance: Avoiding association with one’s privileged group. Dismantle: Actively working to reduce systemic privilege through actions like supporting affirmative action.
Findings of Rotella & Richeson (2013):	People are less likely to remember atrocities when committed by their ingroup, which reduces guilt and reparative actions.
Discrepancy between predicted and actual responses to prejudice:	People think they’ll confront prejudice but often don’t. Kawakami et al. (2009) showed that participants still chose to work with a racist confederate.
Common threats to high status:	Demographic changes: Fear of becoming a numerical minority. Racial/gender progress: Threats to traditional hierarchies. Pro-diversity messaging: Perceived as reverse discrimination by dominant groups.
Threats from demographic shifts (Craig & Richeson, 2014):	Thinking about a 'majority-minority' future led to greater pro-White and anti-minority biases.
Threats from racial/gender progress (Wilkins et al., 2016):	White participants exhibited lower self-esteem after reading about racial progress but recovered by attributing failures to racial bias.
Effects of pro-diversity messages (Dover, Major, Kaiser, 2016):	White participants perceived higher discrimination risk in pro-diversity organizations, showing physiological stress responses.
Individual-level interventions:	Counter-stereotypical exemplars: Exposure to positive examples that challenge stereotypes. Evaluative conditioning: Pairing outgroup members with positive stimuli. Perspective-taking: Encouraging empathy. Self-regulation: Training individuals to inhibit automatic prejudiced responses.
Group/structural interventions:	Contact: Meaningful intergroup interactions under equal-status conditions. Social norms: Highlighting inclusive norms can reduce prejudice. Common ingroup identity: Emphasizing shared identity across groups.
Findings of Dasgupta & Asgari (2004):	Exposure to female leaders reduced gender-leadership biases on implicit association tests (IAT).
Effective interventions (Lai et al., 2014):	Using vivid counter-stereotypical scenarios. Associating Black individuals with positive attributes. Engaging participants personally.
Implicit vs. explicit bias:	Interventions show greater effectiveness in reducing implicit biases compared to explicit biases, though effects are often short-term.
Meta-analysis findings (Paluck et al., 2021):	Interventions typically had small effects, especially in large, rigorous studies. Recommendations include targeting structural changes (e.g., laws and policies) for greater impact.
Benefits of institutional diversity:	Better decision-making: Diverse groups consider more perspectives and make fewer errors. Social and economic gains: Countries with greater diversity often show higher economic prosperity.
Importance of representation:	Role modeling: Inspires marginalized groups to pursue leadership roles. Reducing stereotype threat: Alleviates performance anxiety caused by negative stereotypes.
Ideological approaches to diversity:	Assimilationism: Advocates for cultural conformity. Colorblindness: Ignores group differences but risks maintaining systemic inequities. Multiculturalism: Celebrates differences but can reinforce stereotypes. Interculturalism: Promotes shared unity while recognizing cultural interactions.
Findings of Stout et al. (2011):	Exposure to female experts increased women’s self-efficacy and interest in STEM fields, inoculating against gender bias.
