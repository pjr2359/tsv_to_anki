Social Integration	Participation in a broad range of social relationships. Measured by number/types of social roles and participation frequency. Linked to better health via Main Effect Model (Berkman & Syme).
Social Support	Resources from social network to cope with stress. Types: Instrumental (aid), Informational (advice), Emotional (care). Perceived availability is key. Linked to health via Stress Buffering Model (Cohen).
Stress Buffering Model	Social connections protect health by providing resources to cope with stress, reducing its negative impact. Requires match between support type and stressor.
Main Effect Model	Social connectedness benefits health regardless of stress levels, through social control, positive psychological states (identity, purpose), and promoting healthy behaviors. Associated with Social Integration.
Loneliness	Subjective feeling of discrepancy between desired and actual social relationships (Quality of connection). Distinct from social isolation.
Social Isolation	Objective state of being alone, few relationships, infrequent contact (Quantity of connection). Distinct from loneliness.
Health Risks of Loneliness/Isolation	Increased mortality (~26-32%), cardiovascular disease, weakened immunity, sleep issues, cognitive decline (dementia risk), depression/anxiety, suicidality.
Berkman & Syme (1979)	Alameda County Study. Found a strong link between lack of social ties (low social integration) and increased risk of mortality from all causes. Classic evidence for Main Effect Model.
Cohen (Researcher)	Major researcher on stress, social support, and health. Emphasized perceived support and the Stress Buffering Model. Studied link between stress/conflict and susceptibility to illness (e.g., common cold).
Cacioppo (Researcher)	Studied loneliness extensively, viewing it as a biological drive. Researched physiological correlates (cortisol, gene expression, cardiovascular) and health consequences. Noted loneliness can spread in networks.
Fiske's Relational Models	Four elementary models of social relationships: Communal Sharing, Authority Ranking, Equality Matching, Market Pricing.
Nearby Nature (Wells & Evans, 2003)	Study showed vegetation near rural children's homes buffered the negative impact of stressful life events on psychological distress and self-worth. Evidence for nature as a stress buffer.
Ulrich (1984) Hospital Study	Patients recovering from surgery with window views of nature had better outcomes (shorter stays, less pain medication) than those viewing a brick wall.
Social Identity	Part of self-concept derived from group memberships (race, gender, age, occupation, etc.). Crucial in adolescence (Erikson).
Contingencies of Social Identity	Cues in a setting signaling evaluation based on one's social identity, making it salient and potentially threatening (Claude Steele).
Stereotype Threat	Fear of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group, leading to anxiety and impaired performance in relevant domains (Claude Steele).
Examples of Stereotype Threat	African Americans on intelligence tests, women in math, elderly on memory tests, White men in some athletics. Effects strongest for those invested in the domain.
Belonging	A fundamental human need; a sense of connectedness, acceptance, and inclusion in a social group or achievement domain.
Belonging Uncertainty	Doubt about whether one fits in or will be accepted, especially when linked to a negatively stereotyped identity. Can undermine motivation.
Identity Engagement Model (Cohen & Garcia)	Model explaining how salient identity -> vigilance for threat cues -> threat appraisal -> coping -> performance outcomes. Emphasizes recursive cycles.
Confirming vs. Disconfirming Cues (Identity Threat)	*Confirming:* Signals you don't belong/fit stereotype -> impairs performance. *Disconfirming:* Signals value/capability despite identity -> reduces threat, improves performance.
Stereotype Lift	Performance boost for non-stereotyped individuals when negative stereotypes about *other* groups are salient (Walton & Cohen).
Growth Mindset (Dweck)	Belief that abilities (like intelligence) are malleable and can be developed through effort and learning. Contrasts with Fixed Mindset (abilities are innate). Intervention can boost performance.
Self-Affirmation Theory	People are motivated to maintain self-integrity. Affirming core values or identities can buffer against threats to the self in other domains (e.g., academic performance).
Values-Based Self-Affirmation	Intervention involving reflecting on and writing about important personal values to buffer self-integrity.
Identity-Based Self-Affirmation	Intervention involving reflecting positively on important social identities to buffer self-integrity and potentially boost self-esteem.
Hoffman & Schacter (2024) Study Finding	Both values-based and identity-based self-affirmation interventions protected adolescents from self-esteem declines during the high school transition, compared to a control group.
Walton & Cohen Belonging Intervention	Intervention framing social adversity/belonging uncertainty in college as common and transient for *all* students improved minority students' GPA and well-being long-term.
Steele (Researcher)	Developed theory of Stereotype Threat and work on social identity contingencies. Also worked on self-affirmation.
Dweck (Researcher)	Known for research on Mindset (Growth vs. Fixed) and its impact on motivation, achievement, and resilience.
Cohen & Garcia (Researchers)	Developed the Identity Engagement Model, linking identity salience, threat, belonging, and achievement over time. Researched interventions like self-affirmation.
Walton (Researcher)	Known for research on belonging, social-psychological interventions (especially framing adversity), and stereotype lift.
Wisdom (Sternberg Definition)	Use of knowledge, abilities, ethics, values, mediated by reflection, for a *common good*, balancing multiple interests (intra-, inter-, extra-personal) over time, adapting/shaping/selecting environments.
Why is Wisdom Needed in STEM?	To ensure technological/scientific advancements serve the common good, consider long-term consequences and ethics, and avoid foolish/toxic outcomes despite high intelligence.
Foolishness (Sternberg)	Acting unwisely despite intellectual capability, often due to cognitive fallacies (e.g., egocentrism, omniscience, omnipotence, invulnerability, unrealistic optimism).
Dark Triad Traits	Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy. Sternberg notes people sometimes prefer leaders exhibiting these traits, which can lead to foolish/toxic outcomes.
Sunk-Cost Fallacy	Continuing a course of action due to past investment (time, money, effort), even if it's no longer the wisest path. A type of foolish thinking.
Ethical Disengagement	Justifying or rationalizing unethical behavior, convincing oneself that ethical standards don't apply. A component of foolishness.
Flynn Effect	Observed rise in IQ scores across generations. Raises questions about whether intelligence or wisdom is increasing (Machado Challenge).
Sternberg (Researcher)	Extensive work on intelligence (Triarchic Theory), creativity, and wisdom (Balance Theory). Critical of overemphasis on IQ and advocates for teaching wisdom.
Social Relationship Interventions: Challenges	Interventions providing support from strangers often show weak results in large trials. Effectiveness depends on context (e.g., information vs. emotion) and individual needs/existing support.
Potential Harm of Misguided Support	Example: Study where peer *emotional* support harmed cancer patients who already had high levels of natural support; *informational* support was more helpful for adjustment.
Marital Status and Mortality (Kaplan & Kronick, 2006)	Large US study found married individuals had lower odds of dying over 8 years compared to never married, divorced/separated, or widowed individuals.
Marital Quality and Health	Quality matters. Kaiser Permanente study found equality/companionship protected women against death over 15 years (not significant for men in that study).
Recursion (in Identity Engagement Model)	Psychological processes (like threat perception) and environmental factors interact in repeating cycles over time (e.g., threat lowers performance, which increases future threat). Interventions aim to disrupt negative cycles.
